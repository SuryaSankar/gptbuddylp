    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: [Insert Date]</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for using GPTBuddy! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how GPTBuddy operates and how it handles your data while respecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p><strong>GPTBuddy does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to external servers or third parties.</strong> All operations and functionalities provided by GPTBuddy are performed locally within your browser.</p>

    <h3>Details on Operations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sidebar Navigation:</strong> GPTBuddy reads the content of supported AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity) to generate a list of questions in the conversation thread. This operation is entirely local and does not involve data transmission.</li>
      <li><strong>UI Integration:</strong> The extension injects a sidebar and styling into supported platforms to enhance navigation. This does not access or modify the platform’s backend or server-side data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>GPTBuddy requests the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab to display the sidebar and process the page content locally.</li>
      <li><strong>Host Permissions:</strong> Required to enable the sidebar functionality on supported domains (e.g., chatgpt.com, claude.ai, perplexity.ai, gemini.google.com).</li>
      <li><strong>Scripting:</strong> Enables GPTBuddy to inject JavaScript and CSS for the sidebar functionality on supported platforms.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are solely used to provide the extension’s core functionality and do not involve external data sharing.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>GPTBuddy does not integrate with or rely on any third-party services for its functionality. All actions are performed locally in your browser.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since GPTBuddy does not collect or transmit any user data, there is no risk of data exposure or breach through the extension. Your data remains secure within the platforms you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the extension’s functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be communicated through the Chrome Web Store listing.</p>
